Where am I?
Wait!! I need to get the stick back to my master.
Why are you here, little dog?
I am here to get a stick that fell into this hole.
A mere stick? Do you think it is worth it to come down here just for a mere stick?
Anything is worth it for my master. He is my world and everything.
I love my master. I don't want to let my master down.
If I can't get the stick back, master will not love me anymore. 
*sigh* Do you even know that this place is a magical abyss?
Any path you took can lead you to a random place, and there are a lot of dangerous monsters.
Aren't you afraid?
No, I am not.
I just need to retrieve the stick back to my master.
*sigh* you seem stubborn for a little dog.
Fine then, but you won't survive this perilous journey like this.
I will lend you my power. 
Thank you mister. 
*sigh*
