Where am I?
Wait!! I need to get the stick back to my master.
Why are you here, little one?
I am here to get a stick back that has fallen into this hole.
A mere stick? Do you think it is even worth it?
Anything is worth it for my master. He is my world and everything.
*sigh* Do you even know that this place is a magical abyss.
Any passage you took can lead you to a random place, and there are a lot of dangerous monsters.
Aren't you afraid.
No, I am not.
I just need to retrieve the stick back to my master.
*sigh* you seem stubborn for a little dog.
Fine then, but you won't survive like this if you are going on this perilous journey to get a mere stick.
I will lend you my power. 
Thank you Mr. 
*sigh
