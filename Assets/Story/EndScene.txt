What happened?
I tried to tell you, but you were too eager to get the stick.
You died before even reaching the abyss.
I told you it is not worth trying.
No...
It is worth trying.
Even though I didn't get the desired result in the end. 
At least I know that I tried my best for my master because I love him.
I am happy that I tried.
